# Installing Macmoji: as easy as 🔢

1. [Download `emoji substitutions.plist`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warpling/Macmoji/master/emoji%20substitutions.plist) (make sure it has the extension `.plist`)
2. Open System Preferences and navigate to **Keyboard** > **Text**
3. Drag the `emoji substitutions.plist` to the list of substitutions to add them
4. Type something like `:boom:` or `:blackbox:` and hit space after! 💥⬛️

##### Know bash?
1. Just run `./scripts/macmoji install` (or even `uninstall`!)

## Other Installations
Thanks to the fantastic work of [rael9](https://github.com/rael9) Macmoji now has a script for generating other template files (Maestro, Alfred, etc) from the latest emoji substitutions. If you add to the base `plist` simply run `python scripts/update-km.py` from the base directory and the templates in `templates/*` will be created in the base directory. Creating new templates is [easy and highly encouraged](https://github.com/warpling/Macmoji/pull/14#issuecomment-232850622)!

### Keyboard Maestro Version

If you'd prefer to use Keyboard Maestro to handle the substiutions, import the emojis-km6.kmmacros file in the Keyboard Maestro Editor. Emoji can be added in the editor or by editing the emojis-km6.kmmacros file before importing. The macro can then be exported to back up your changes.

(This macro was created and tested using version 6. It has not been tested with other versions.)

## FAQ

#### 🤔 Can I change/remove substitutions?
Yep! Macmoji substitutions are ordinary text substitutions. Double click an entry to change it; highlight and hit delete to remove it. To highlight multiple substitutions select one and then while holding shift select another. You can always add your own too of course!

Some fun recommendations:

| replace  | with           |
| :------- | :------------- |
| ehh      | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   |
| tflip    | (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ |
| eml      | your@email.com |

#### 💩 Why the colons?
Well it's what [Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202931348-Emoji-and-emoticons)/GitHub/Trello does *and* it prevents macOS's autocomplete from being too aggressive when you're just trying to type normal sentences like, "ghost bananas are cool." 👻🍌🆒

#### 🖐🏽 What about skin tones?
Type your skin-tonable emoji, then type `:skin-tone-3:` (any number 1-5) to add the skintone. They should combine!

#### 😱 I have suggestions and mistakes to point out!
Let me know in the issues *orrr* file a [pull request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)!

#### 😯 Can I back-up or share my substitutions?
Yep! Highlight and drag out the ones you want to back-up or share and you'll get a neat little `.plist`. Drag them back in and only the unique ones will be added.


## Known Problems

#### 😫 Macmoji isn't working in Chrome
Yeah it's a bummer. Chrome bypasses the system's autocomplete (and a few other things), but a passable work around is to open Spotlight (`cmd + space`) type your emojis there, copy, paste, and you're good to go! 👍

#### 😫 The substitutions are showing up on my iPhone in weird ways…
Keyboard text substitutions sync across iCloud. I haven't found a way to disable it short of removing the substitutions and iOS seems to ignore colons 🤕. I will update this if I learn of a solution.

#### 😠 Sometimes it just stops working in some applications
No clue. Beats me. Have a hunch why? I'd love to hear it!

## Change Log

The best way to update is to remove all previously added substitutions and then drag in the plist again (hold `shift` to select all the colon clad substitutions).
**Tip:** You can always back-up substitutions by selecting and dragging them out of the list!
