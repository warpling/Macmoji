# Installing Macmoji: as easy as 🔢

#### _Psst!_ Upgrading from a previous version of Macmoji? [Read this first](#change-log).

1. [Download `emoji substitutions.plist`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/warpling/Macmoji/master/emoji%20substitutions.plist) (make sure it has the extension `.plist`)
2. Open System Preferences and navigate to **Keyboard** > **Text**
3. Drag the `emoji substitutions.plist` to the list of substitutions to add them
4. Type something like `:boom:` or `:blackbox:` and hit `Space` after! 💥⬛️

##### Know bash?
1. Just run `./scripts/macmoji install` (or even `uninstall`!)
(Thanks [mshick](https://github.com/mshick)!)

**Note:** This will install `coreutils` from homebrew if homebrew is available on your system.

## Other Installations
Thanks to the fantastic work of [rael9](https://github.com/rael9) Macmoji now has a script for generating other template files (Maestro, Alfred, etc) from the latest emoji substitutions list. If you add emoji substitutions to the base `.plist` simply run `python scripts/update-output.py` from the base directory and the various outputs based on the templates in `templates/*` will be generated in the base directory. Creating new templates is [easy and highly encouraged](https://github.com/warpling/Macmoji/pull/14#issuecomment-232850622)!

### Keyboard Maestro Version

If you'd prefer to use Keyboard Maestro to handle the substitutions, import the `emojis-km6.kmmacros` file in the Keyboard Maestro Editor.

*(This macro was created and tested using version 6. It has not been tested with other versions.)*

### Alfred Version

If you'd prefer to import these shortcuts with Alfred as Snippets just drag the `.alfredsnippets` into Alfred's Snippet preferences!

## FAQ

#### 🤔 Can I change/remove substitutions?
Yep! Macmoji substitutions are ordinary text substitutions. Double click an entry to change it; highlight and hit delete to remove it. To highlight multiple substitutions select one and then while holding `Shift` select another. You can always add your own too of course!

Some fun recommendations:

| replace  | with           |
| :------- | :------------- |
| ehh      | ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   |
| tflip    | (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ |
| eml      | your@email.com |

#### 💩 Why the colons?
Well it's what [Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202931348-Emoji-and-emoticons)/GitHub/Trello does *and* it prevents macOS's autocomplete from being too aggressive when you're just trying to type normal sentences like, "ghost bananas are cool." 👻🍌🆒

#### 🖐🏽 What about skin tones?
Type your skin-tonable emoji, then type `:skin-tone-3:` (any number 1-5) to add the skintone. They should combine!

#### 😱 I have suggestions and mistakes to point out!
Let me know in the issues *orrr* file a [pull request](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/)!

#### 😯 Can I back-up or share my substitutions?
Yep! Highlight and drag out the ones you want to back-up or share and you'll get a neat little `.plist`. Drag them back in and only the unique ones will be added.


## Known Problems

#### 😫 Macmoji isn't working in Chrome
Yeah it's a bummer. Chrome bypasses the system's autocomplete (and a few other things), but a passable work around is to open Spotlight (`Cmd + Space`) type your emojis there, copy, paste, and you're good to go! 👍

#### 😫 The substitutions are showing up on my iPhone in weird ways…
Keyboard text substitutions sync across iCloud. I haven't found a way to disable it short of removing the substitutions and iOS seems to ignore colons 🤕. I will update this if I learn of a solution.

#### 😠 Sometimes it just stops working in some applications
No clue. Beats me. Have a hunch why? I'd love to hear it!

## Change Log

Looking to update to the [latest release](https://github.com/warpling/Macmoji/releases/latest)? The best way to update is to remove all previously added substitutions, then drag in the `.plist` again (hold `Shift` to select all the colon clad substitutions).
**Tip:** You can always back-up substitutions by selecting and dragging them out of the list!
